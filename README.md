# Youtube Downloader  
A simple YouTube downloader writed with PySide2 allowing you to select your video or/and audio stream and to merge them.  
## How to Download ?  
Go to the [latest release download page](https://github.com/SiniKraft/YoutubeDownloader/releases)  
### Windows :  
Download the setup to install easily, or extract the portable version.  
Just run Youtube Downloader.  
Warning: Currently merging works only on 64-bits architectures !  
### Others :  
Download the [main source zip](https://sinikraft.github.io/website/magic/dllatest?repo_link=https://api.github.com/repos/SiniKraft/YoutubeDownloader/releases/latest)  
Extract it and try to run qtapp.py  
You'll need to install PySide2, qt-material and pytube (and python-ffmpeg for merging).  
Should work on python 3.6 +  
### Extensions ?
Currently, only Windows browsers are supported.  
I Highly recommend you to use Firefox, which is the only one respecting your privacy.  
Just click on the Firefox-extension.xpi file and it should install.  
For other browsers, download Chrome-Edge-Opera-and-more zip, extract it and follow instructions of the ReadMe file.
